## What You'll Find Here

You might be wondering what an indoor cycling studio is doing on GitHub!  While our primary focus is getting you sweating and feeling amazing on the bike, we also believe in leveraging technology to enhance the Handlebar experience and streamline our operations.

This GitHub organization is primarily used for:

* **Internal Tooling & Scripts:** We develop and maintain internal scripts and tools to help manage various aspects of our business, from website automation to operational efficiency.
* **Exploring Tech Innovations:** We're always looking for ways to innovate and improve. You might find repositories here related to experimental projects exploring fitness tech and digital enhancements for our studio and community.
* **Potential Open Source Contributions (Future):**  While not our primary focus currently, we are open to exploring opportunities to share useful tools or resources with the wider fitness community in the future.

**Don't expect to find customer-facing applications or open-source cycling software (yet!).**  Our repositories here are more likely to be focused on the "behind-the-scenes" technology that powers The Handlebar.
